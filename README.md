# ThErapy-Screening

ThErapy Screening is an android app that improves the colletion of information from patients of Child Therapists
  
What it does?

 - The app is meant to be installed in a device that will be located at the front desk of a therapist's office 
 - The app lets a therapist set up his/her device by signing in with his/her Google account so that the device is ready to send the collected information from patients to his/her email 
 - Once set up with a Google account, the app is ready to be used by patients 
 - The app asks patients (both parent and child) for their information such as names, last names, ages, etc and stores it internally
 - After information is gathered, the app prompts the parent to complete a questionnarie about his/her child's behavior
 - After the parent completes his/her portion of the questionnarie, the app prompts the parent to let his/her child complete the following portion
 - As both the parent and child answer to the questions, their answers get stored internally as well
 - Once the questionnarie is over, the app prompts the patients to return the device to the front desk where the person is change presses the "next" button which instantly sends an email to the therapist with a report generated with the patients' answers.
 - With this report, the therapist can compare and contrast the answers of the parent and child before, during, and after the appointment
